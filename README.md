# An Open Source Winlink Mail Client
Open source email program for the winlink radio email system

Now's your chance to help design a new cross-platform email client for Winlink. 
Initially, this repository will be concerned with gathering ideas - your ideas. 
You can submit new ideas, comment on what others have suggested, or even tell us what you don't want.
Use the 'Issues' menu item to open a page where you can make your suggestions and comments.

The [project wiki](https://github.com/ARSFI/winlink-mail-client/wiki) will be updated to reflect adopted suggestions.

This is going to be a large project that will need your help. Until an initial design is nailed down there won't be much development. But, after that we'll need help with coding the different modules, designing and creating the user interface, testing, documentation, etc. We'll also ask for volunteers to champion the different areas, manage pull requests, and help new people get up to speed. 

Raise your hand. Be part of the team.
